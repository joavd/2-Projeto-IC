## Our solution

In order to find our solution it was necessary a lot of effort and dedication, after several tries we reunited with
other classmates to make a game that works according to the teacher's instructions.
We starded by taking the exemple given by the teacher and modifided in order to test what we could do. After having an
idea of what was done, we started creating the data structure to be able to comunicate with the world, afterwards tests
were made to play with the agents' positions.
After we had an idea of the behaviour of the "engine" we did the artificial inteligence of the agents.
All the possible outcomes of the movement in the toroidal grid were calculated for a realistic movement, where it'll
find the nearest agent regardless of the side of the grid.

## User guide

Our game is very simple; if you're using Ubuntu OS you have to open the folder in the terminal and run `make`. 
If you are using Windows, you have to install `*MinGW*`, and open the folder in the command line and run 
`mingw32-make.exe`.
Afterwards, the terminal/command line will open with a call to the graphic library where it'll be possible to visualize
the world. The game will run until it shows a playable agent and, in that case, it'll wait for the player's input.
